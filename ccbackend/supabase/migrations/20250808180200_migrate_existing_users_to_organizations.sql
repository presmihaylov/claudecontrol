-- Data migration for existing users to organizations
-- NOTE: This migration will be handled by the application layer
-- since ULID generation requires Go code.
-- 
-- The UsersService.GetOrCreateUser() method will handle:
-- 1. Creating organizations for existing users without one
-- 2. Associating existing users with their new organization
--
-- This file serves as a placeholder to track the migration step.

-- Placeholder - actual migration handled by application layer
