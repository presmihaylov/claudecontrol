# Discord Bot Example

This is a simple Discord bot written in Go using the [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) library. The bot demonstrates how to:

- Detect when the bot is mentioned in messages
- Add emoji reactions to messages (thumbs up üëç)
- Respond to mentions with a personalized message
- Handle additional commands like `!greet`

## Features

1. **Mention Detection**: The bot detects when it's mentioned using `@BotName`
2. **Automatic Reactions**: Adds a thumbs up (üëç) emoji reaction to messages where the bot is mentioned
3. **Response Messages**: Replies with a personalized message when mentioned
4. **Additional Commands**: Supports a `!greet @user` command with wave emoji reaction

## Prerequisites

1. **Go 1.22+**: Make sure you have Go installed
2. **Discord Application**: You need to create a Discord application and bot

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Discord Application

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click "New Application" and give it a name
3. Go to the "Bot" section in the sidebar
4. Click "Add Bot"
5. Copy the bot token (you'll need this for the `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable)

### 2. Set Bot Permissions

In the "Bot" section, scroll down to "Privileged Gateway Intents" and enable:
- MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT (required to read message content)

### 3. Invite Bot to Server

1. Go to the "OAuth2" > "URL Generator" section
2. Select "bot" scope
3. Select the following bot permissions:
   - Send Messages
   - Add Reactions
   - Read Message History
   - View Channels
4. Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser to invite the bot to your server

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd examples/discord-bot
go mod tidy
```

### 5. Set Environment Variable

Set your bot token as an environment variable:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your_bot_token_here"

# Windows
set DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
```

## Running the Bot

```bash
go run main.go
```

You should see:
```
Discord bot is now running. Press CTRL-C to exit.
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Mention
Type in any Discord channel where the bot has access:
```
@YourBot hello there!
```

**Result:**
- The bot adds a üëç reaction to your message
- The bot replies: "Hello @YourUsername! You mentioned me. Thanks for the message!"

### Greet Command
```
!greet @SomeUser
```

**Result:**
- The bot adds a üëã reaction to your message  
- The bot replies: "Hello @SomeUser! üëã You were greeted by @YourUsername"

## Code Structure

### Main Components

1. **Bot Setup**: Creates Discord session with bot token
2. **Event Handler**: `messageCreate` function handles incoming messages
3. **Mention Detection**: Loops through `m.Mentions` to check if bot was mentioned
4. **Reaction Adding**: Uses `MessageReactionAdd` with Unicode emoji
5. **Message Response**: Uses `ChannelMessageSend` to reply

### Key DiscordGo Functions Used

- `discordgo.New("Bot " + token)` - Create Discord session
- `s.AddHandler(messageCreate)` - Register message event handler
- `s.MessageReactionAdd(channelID, messageID, emoji)` - Add emoji reaction
- `s.ChannelMessageSend(channelID, message)` - Send message to channel
- `m.Mentions` - Array of users mentioned in the message
- `m.Author.Bot` - Check if message author is a bot

### Bot Safety Features

- **Bot Detection**: Ignores messages from other bots (including itself) using `m.Author.Bot`
- **Error Handling**: Logs errors for reactions and message sending
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Handles CTRL-C to cleanly close the Discord connection

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Your Discord bot's token from the Developer Portal | Yes |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Error creating Discord session"**: Check that your bot token is correct and properly set
2. **"Error opening connection"**: Verify your bot token and internet connection
3. **Bot doesn't respond**: Ensure the bot has proper permissions and MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT is enabled
4. **Reactions not working**: Check that the bot has "Add Reactions" permission in the channel

### Debug Logs

The bot logs important events:
- When it's mentioned: `Bot mentioned by {username} in channel {channelID}`
- Errors with reactions: `Error adding reaction: {error}`
- Errors with messages: `Error sending message: {error}`

## Extending the Bot

You can easily extend this bot by:

1. **Adding more commands**: Check for different prefixes in the message content
2. **More emoji reactions**: Use different Unicode emoji characters
3. **Database integration**: Store user interactions or preferences
4. **Slash commands**: Implement modern Discord slash commands
5. **Multiple server support**: Handle different server configurations
